vHLTVMaker

This is the re-made version of the vHLVMaker app that I initially wrote a few years ago.
Now it is truly automatic, you don't need to do anything except just choosing the input
& output model files.

The interface should be pretty intuitive. If you still didn't get it the purpose of this
program is to turn any Half-Life weapon model into HLTV-style meaning that it won't have
the idle & draw animations.

If you have any problems with the program try running it in Administrator mode,
if you get a missing DLL error install Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable package.
