# Info
vHLTVMaker is an application written for making easy HLTV models using any v_ models.
# Usage
Firstly you need to get MilkShape3D or Jed's Half-Life Model Viewer to decompile & compile models.
After successful decompilation open vHLTVMaker & show to it paths to idle & draw .smd files from decompiled model.
Click "Make HLTV" & wait for 3-4 seconds.
Now you can compile model, and here is your HLTV model

In future I'll add automatical decompile/compile of model using mdldec.exe :)
